# WaterFlowSensor
Prepaid System Merchant Water Supply

Input the refill code from the keypad will be converted into water balance and trigger the relay to open the water valve. The water flow sensor will read the debit of the water that released. When the balance is below 1 liter, the bizzer will sound as a sign that the balance will soon run out. When the balance runs out, the water valve will close.
